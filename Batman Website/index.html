            <p> <strong>Batman</strong> is a fictional comic character created by artist <u>Bob Kane</u> and writer <u>
                    Bill
                    Finger</u>

                Batman first appeared in DC comics in the year 1939 and soon became very popular. Batman is a superhero
                who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by artist Bob Kane and
                writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939.
                In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
                philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises based in Gotham City. Kane, Finger, and future DC writers
                accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin, allies Alfred Pennyworth
                and James Gordon, and foes such as Catwoman, the Scarecrow, the Penguin, and his archenemy, the Joker.
                Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of
                his parents Thomas and Martha; he trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired
                persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night.
                <br>

                Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane
                frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic
                superhero into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in
                1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed
                criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike
                most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting
                skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be
                associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the
                character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark
                Knight Returns by Frank Miller.
                <br>
                DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as
                Vertigo and Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running
                comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as
                Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In
                addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such
                as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993–1994 "Knightfall" story arc and Dick Grayson, the first Robin,
                for a three-year period from 2009 to 2011. DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of
                Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation
                from the Flashpoint (2011) event, and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.
                <br>
                One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic
                book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful
                superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold
                around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego Batman and video games like the Batman: Arkham
                series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman
                television series played by Adam West and in films by Michael Keaton in Batman (1989) and Batman Returns
                (1992), Christian Bale in The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012), and Ben Affleck in the DC Extended
                Universe (2016–present). Kevin Conroy, Jason O'Mara, and Will Arnett, among others, have provided the
                character's voice.

            <img id="image" src="./img/wayne.PNG" alt="Dr.wayne">;

            <p id="identity">Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist who resides just
                outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha
                Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals. Wayne
                averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which
                was amassed through investment in real estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the
                profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. Bruce Wayne resides just outside of Gotham
                City in Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation but is more
                widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status
                women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life,
                crime-fighting accounts for most of his time.</p>
